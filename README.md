# LIRI

### Introduction
For this assignment, I built a command line node application called "LIRI".  LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface that takes in parameters and give you back data.

### This is what LIRI can do:

#### Concerts
`node liri.js concert-this <insert artist/band name here>
This will take the artist's or band's name and return their concert information below:
    * Name of the venue
    * Venue location
    * Date of the Event
