# LIRI

### Introduction
For this assignment, I built a command line node application called "LIRI".  LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface that takes in parameters and give you back data.  LIRI is programmed to provide you with information for concerts, songs, and movies.

### How to use LIRI
Type "node liri.js" in your command line and press enter for further instructions, or just follow the instructions and screen shots provided below.


#### Concerts
`node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`
This will take the artist's or band's name and return their concert information below:

     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event
