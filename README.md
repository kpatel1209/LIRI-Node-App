### Introduction
For this assignment, I built a command line node application called "LIRI".  LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface that takes in parameters and give you back data.

### How to use LIRI?
LIRI is equipped with the four command line functions below:
    * `concert-this`
    * `spotify-this-song`
    * `movie-this`
    * `do-what-it-says`
